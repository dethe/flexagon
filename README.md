1. First, you will need to have six images that you would like to use. You can bring them into the tool with the file picker or by drag-and-drop. You can also take pictures with the camera. The hexagon at the top of the tool will show your picture as it will look on the paper. You can drag to pan the image and the mouse wheel can be used to zoom the image. Select each of the six radio buttons for Images 1-6 and repeat the process until you are happy with all six images.

2. (If you have access to a cutting machine like a Cricut.) Use the Save [Coming soon!] button to save the SVG of your work and import that into Cricut Design Space. You will need to mark the blue lines for cutting and the grey lines for scoring. Use heavy paper, thin cardstock, or photo paper. If you have a colour printer attached, the Cricut will prompt you to print, then feed the result into the printer. If you do not have an attached printer, you can output a PDF file with alignment marks that can be printed and then fed into the Cricut.

3. (If you don't have a Cricut.) You can print from the web without saving the SVG first. Carefully cut out the two shapes. The more precisely you can cut them, the better the final result.

4. Now that you have the two pieces cut out (whether by Cricut or by hand), you can fold each of them in half the long way. Again, the more precise you are, the better the final results. Make sure the edges line up. You should end up with two strips printed on both sides, each with a A/a and B/b triangle at each end. Glue the two sides of the folded paper together and allow the glue to set.

5. Now we want to join the two strips into one. Match the two triangles labelled A (upper- and lower-case) and glue them so the paper forms one long strip of 19 triangles printed on both sides with two B triangles at the ends. DO NOT GLUE THE B TRIANGLES YET!

6. (If you don't have a Cricut or don't have a scoring tool for the Cricut.) We want the triangles pre-folded, so starting at one end, fold the first triangle back behind the strip (mountain fold). Make a good crease, then unfold it and move to the next triangle, folding on the lines separating the triangles, one by one, until every line has been pre-creased. Again, precision is important.

7. This step is complicated and I'll make a video to help.

Enjoy!
