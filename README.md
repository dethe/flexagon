An HTML page that maps six images to the six faces of a hexahexaflexagon.

This is an example for an upcoming event, using preliminary graphics (thanks Chris and Carla). Not for public release just yet.


Instructions: Clone the repo, add your own images with the same aspect ratio (2.9 / 2.5 should do) and change the names of the image files on the first line of code in hexa.js. 

For extra credit you can add an interface to load images from the web and crop them the the right aspect ratio, but I'm not going to get to that anytime soon.

Load the file in Firefox and print double-sided, in landscape mode, flipping on the short edge. You may have to adjust the layout slightly depending how well your printer aligns the two sides. All the extra images will be hidden by a print stylesheet.

Folding instructions are here: http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~infinity/Infinity%2012/hexaflex.html You will have to glue the two strips into one longer strip first (hopefully it is clear where to glue).

Please excuse the messy code, it was Coded In A Hurryâ„¢

Enjoy!
